# GroceryStore

This is a project I initially made during a Full Stack Developer Bootcamp in 2019 with [DevPoint Labs](https://www.devpointlabs.com/)

I decided to rebuild it from scratch. I take no credit for the idea & objectives. That

### Basic Objectives
   Display a menu in the console for the user to interact with. 
   Create a nested hash that represent items at a grocery store. 
   Create a menu option to add items to a user's grocery cart. 
   Create a menu option to display all the items in the cart. 
   Create a menu option to remove an item from the users cart. 
   Create a menu option to show the total cost of all the items in the user's cart.  


### Bonus Objectives:
   Assign the user an amount of money to start. 
   Give the user the option to "Check out". 
   If they have enough money, their cart gets cleared and money is subtracted. 
   If they don't have enough money, they have to delete items. 
   Apply some sort of coupon system. 
   For example, a 20% off coupon that takes the price of all items down by 20%. 
   Apply taxes to transaction.  
   Grocery store items have a quantity. (They can be out of stock)
